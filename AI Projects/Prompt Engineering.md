## Introducing Today's Project!

In this project, I will demonstrate prompt engineering techniques to help create a better output for my prompts. 

### Tools and Techniques

The AI model I used was ChatGPT. Key techniques I learnt include audience and role prompts, clarifying questions, decomposition, prompt chaining, self critique, and meta prompting. 

### Project reflection

This project took me 1 hour to complete. The most challenging part was the secret mission. It was most rewarding to see the changes in output of my chatbot. 

I did this project today to learn more about prompt engineering so I can become more productive at work. This project did meet my goals.

## Starting the Conversation

Prompt engineering is creating strong prompts for AI to give you the best possible answers. AI tools use prompts behind the scenes to help craft responses to help meet the users needs.

I started my project with a basic prompt, asking ChatGPT what I should do at a conference. 

My initial impressions of the response are that this answer has alot of the key ideas regarding what to do at a conference. It is helpful because it gives me general ideas for what I must do at a conference. Although, it's not specific.

## Basic Prompt Techniques

Foundational strategies to refine my basic prompt include adding roles and audience, clarifying questions, decomposition, and adding a desired format of response. 

Once I used these techniques, I noticed that the AI's response changed by becoming more specific. 
I thought the techniques that made the biggest difference were asking clarifying questions and decomposition.

## Advanced Techniques

More advanced techniques include prompt chaining, which is where we use the output of the last response as the input for the next prompt. For example, I asked ChatGPT to list common scenarios an alien would face, and then to provide actionable tips. 

Another technique is self-critiquing, which means the AI model will critique its work. ChatGPT responded to this by giving step-by-step improvements and an overall rating of its work. Then I asked it to implement those changes.

## Specialized Techniques

Reverse engineering is helpful when we have a desired output in mind and want the AI to help prompt us to be able to achieve this. I used this technique to create and self-critique a prompt to have a guide for aliens in a specific format. 

Creative frameworks are structured approaches that help organise the output of a response well.

## Meta Prompts

A meta-prompt is a prompt that generates prompts to help create a better answer. I structured my meta-prompt by adding in all of the prompt engineering techniques I learnt. 

I tested my meta-prompt by asking to write a prompt for navigating a tech conference. The generated prompt automatically incorporated the layout suggested by the prompt automatically. 

I noticed the generated prompt missed instructions I defined, like actually giving detailed strategies for summarising my learnings after the event. This is because the model has limited capacity and the instructions may have been too lengthy.

## Prompt Templates

I also started a project extension, where I roleplay as an AI engineer who is asking questions to Alex the customer support manager.  My prompt template will focus on providing detailed feedback and requirements to the AI Engineer. 

It identified my stakeholder's needs by running through different scenarios and feelings that the customers may feel and ask. My initial prompt template includes a role and audience, background information, tone and output style, and edge cases.

The feedback I received was regarding the desired tone and style. To respond to feedback, I updated my template by using AI to implement the feedback.
