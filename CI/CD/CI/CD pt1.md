## Launching an EC2 instance

I started this project by launching an EC2 instance because I needed a virtual machine to be able to run our web app entirely on the cloud.

### I also enabled SSH

SSH is a way to connect to a remote server in a secure manner. I enabled SSH so that I could only get access to my EC2 instance, as I was the only one with the private key. It also means that all the data that I transfer is encrypted. 

### Key pairs

A key pair is key to our virtual machine, consisting of a public half and a private key. 

Once I set up my key pair, AWS automatically downloaded my private key in a .pem file.
